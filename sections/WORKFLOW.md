# Workflow

## General

We try to be as agile as possible while maintaining a workflow with rigorious testing.

## Code flow

We develop locally.<br/>
We create a pull request to master/main<br/>
We deploy ruthlessly pacakge fron master/main to FT.<br/>
When all devs agree, we deploy to ST.<br/>
When all stakeholders agree we deploy to AT.<br/>
And lastly we let INFRA Team deploy to PR.<br/>
